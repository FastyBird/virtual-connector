The [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) Virtual Connector is an extension for the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem that enables seamless integration
of virtual devices. It allows developers to easily create devices which will communicate with the [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem.

# About Connector

This connector has some services divided into namespaces. All services are preconfigured and imported into application
container automatically.

```
\FastyBird\Connector\Zigbee2Mqtt
  \Commands - Services used for user console interface
  \Devices - Services which handle communication with virtual devices
  \Drivers - Devices drivers responsible for virtual devices
  \Entities - All entities used by connector
  \Helpers - Useful helpers for reading values, bulding entities etc.
  \Queue - Services related to connector internal communication
  \Schemas - {JSON:API} schemas mapping for API requests
  \Translations - Connector translations
  \Writers - Services for handling request from other services
```

All services, helpers, etc. are written to be self-descriptive :wink:.

> [!TIP]
To better understand what some parts of the connector meant to be used for, please refer to the [Naming Convention](Naming-Convention) page.

## Using Connector

The main purpose of this connector is to provide interface for other developers to create Virtualized devices - software
defined devices. All necessary services are preconfigured and ready to be used and there is no need to develop
some other services or bridges.

> [!TIP]
Find fundamental details regarding the installation and configuration of this connector on the [Configuration](Configuration) page.

This connector is equipped with interactive console. With this console commands you could manage almost all connector features.

* **fb:virtual-connector:install**: is used for connector installation and configuration. With interactive menu you could manage connector and device.
* **fb:virtual-connector:execute**: is used for connector execution. It is simple command that will trigger all services which are related to communication with Virtual devices and other [FastyBird](https://www.fastybird.com) [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) ecosystem services like state storage, or user interface communication.

Each console command could be triggered like this :nerd_face:

```shell
php bin/fb-console fb:virtual-connector:install
```

> [!NOTE]
The path to the console command may vary depending on your FastyBird application distribution. For more information, refer to the FastyBird documentation.
